# MariasMatchSuite
A little Interface to test and demonstrate search and match capabilties of MariaSQL or MySQL and the KoelnerPhonetic query.

Edit Connection Settings in include/config.php

Import Files in SQL (important: Check Definer in KoelnerPhoneticProcedure.sql)

Open in Browser to see m*SQL output.

Explore it / there are some JS Hacks to visualize Keys... (Just click a tablecell)

You can adjust Interface and database settings, 
-> Adjust $Testqueries to your values to demonstrate your data
-> Adjust $TABLE to fit your table
-> Adjust $NUMBERFIELD = to fit your productnumber field
-> Adjust $TEXTFIELD1 = to fit your text field 1
-> Adjust $TEXTFIELD2 = to fit your text field 2
